# Food Vision üçïü•ô

A Simple Deep Learning Demo Application that classifies food images of these 
[101 different Types]("https://github.com/Mr-Hexi/FoodVision/blob/main/class_names.txt).


\
It uses Transfer Learning. The model that we used is [**`EfficientNet B2`**](https://pytorch.org/vision/master/models/generated/torchvision.models.efficientnet_b2.html)
Pretrained computer vision model imported from Pytorch's torchvision module, which
Then we retrained it on the [**`Food 101`**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101) Dataset.
